Well the one article was a 404 to an incorrect page. But it would seem other read it and I was able to see that you need to install then draw the chart. 

# chart docs
The other was an example code for how to do charts. by starting with a canvas node. 
I was intrigued by the destroy, update, reset, render, stop, resize clear. I feel those will be helpful

## Canvas API 
you start with < canvas>
it can render contexts. 
*Drawing* fillRect x y width height (I've done this before with animations); You basically have to define the space you're going to use. 
 You can add colors with fillStyle and strokeStyle
You can draw text much like filling out a rectangle. 
Like color you use fillText and strokeText (text, x, y, [, maxWidth]);
